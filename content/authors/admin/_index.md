# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Hi, I'm Liz. Originally from Peru where my passion for molecular biology started. I did my PhD research in New Zealand focusing on the molecular understanding of an apple fungal pathogen. Currently UI am working in Germany as a postdoctoral fellow focusing on apoplastic effectors of a devastating fungal wheat pathogen.

Hi! I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Environmental Genomics](https://www.environmental-genomics.de/) group at the University of Kiel and Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology.

I have a deep passion for understanding molecular virulence mechanisms of fungal effector proteins, from their interaction with plant susceptible targets, to their recognition by plant immunity proteins and their potential role in manipulation the plant microbiome.

I believe that an understanding of the diverse roles a single fungal effector can play will enable us to better engineer plant resistance, focusing on broad-function effectors that interact with the multiple layers of plant defence.
