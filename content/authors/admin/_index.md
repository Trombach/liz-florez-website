Hi! Welcome to my website! I'm a doctoral candidate at the [University of Auckland's Joint Graduate School in Plant and Food Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/our-research/jgs-plant-and-food-science.html/). I'm based at [Plant & Food Research](https://plantandfood.co.nz/)'s Mount Albert Research Centre.
